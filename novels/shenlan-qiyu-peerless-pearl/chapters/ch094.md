# Chapter 94: Heavenly Demon Bloodline

If one looked down from high above at this moment, one would see that starting from the entrance of the City Lord’s Mansion, a large number of Tiger Demon warriors lay bloodied, strewn across the ground. This woman had fought her way in almost step by step.

Hu Jiaojiao and Hu Rourou were stunned when they saw her. In the next moment, both Princesses’ eyes betrayed open jealousy.

So beautiful. This woman is far too beautiful!

Her Ruby Armor was dazzling. A mane of dark-red hair reached nearly to the ground, pouring behind her like a dark-red waterfall, and those Six Back Spines shimmered with crystalline, translucent light.

“Who are you? How dare you break into my Wild Monster City?” Hu Jiaojiao demanded angrily.

The Ruby Queen pressed her right hand into the void, and an illusory image immediately surfaced, revealing the likenesses of Fa Hua and Lan Ge.

“Have you seen those two?”

Hu Jiaojiao was stunned for a moment. “Them? They were just here a moment ago.”

“Hand them over,” the Ruby Queen said coldly.

Hu Rourou let out a tiger roar. “Who do you think you are? You tell us to hand them over, and we’re supposed to just hand them over?”

“Hmph!” The Ruby Queen was never one for idle talk. She stepped forward, leaving a series of red afterimages behind her. The ferocity of an Eleventh-Rank powerhouse erupted instantly as red light crisscrossed. It lacked the flamboyant aura Hu Jiaojiao and Hu Rourou had shown earlier, but when those streaks of red light shot out, the golden light on the Tiger Demon Princesses dimmed somewhat.

“Heavenly Demon Bloodline!” the two Princesses cried out at the same time.

But they did not retreat. In their world, the word *retreat* had never existed.

The two sisters’ bodies collided. The golden *King* character on their foreheads suddenly shone brightly, and their eyes instantly turned gold. Their indomitable Golden Bloodline erupted.

If the earlier Golden Claw Prison had been their full-power strike, then now this was their do-or-die blow.

With their bodies as the center, a golden sphere of light suddenly expanded outward and blossomed. In the next instant, the sky filled with golden light, turning into countless light-shadows.

The Ruby Queen’s brow furrowed slightly. She half-turned, and the three back-stingers on her right swept out. Three crystalline, translucent red beams blasted forth, cutting into the blossoming golden light.

...

Demon Realm Seashore.

Fa Hua and Lan Ge looked nervously at the sea below the cliff, then at each other, falling silent.

What was bound to come had come. The seventh page of Fa Hua’s Divine Codex, Unravelling The Truth, had sensed the Ruby Queen’s aura and allowed them to complete the teleportation at the first opportunity.

Fortunately, for reasons unknown, the Ruby Queen seemed slower this time, giving them ample time to teleport away.

“I thought she’d given up. I didn’t expect she’d come again—she’s an unrelenting pest!” Lan Ge said grumpily.

Fa Hua glanced at him. “If someone had stolen your heart, you’d probably be like this too.”

Lan Ge said, almost gleeful at his misfortune, “That was taken by you, not me.”

Fa Hua sneered. “If I die, can you live? Childish.”

Lan Ge patted his forehead. “Can’t you stop snapping at me? What do we do now—go into the sea, or keep running?”

Fa Hua’s brow furrowed slightly. He said in a deep voice, “Wild Monster City is one of the Demon Race’s Eight Major Cities. There should reasonably be Great Demons present. The Tiger Demon King of the Tiger Demon Clan should be able to sense the Ruby Queen’s aura. I don’t know why he did not appear immediately. But we cannot gamble. We must change locations.”

He paused, then said decisively, “We cannot enter the sea. If we do, we will face endless pursuit. Right now there is only one place that is safest.”

“Oh?” Lan Ge was puzzled for a moment, but then he reacted. “You mean the Ancestral Court?”

“Not too stupid,” Fa Hua said.

Lan Ge bumped him with his shoulder. “Quiet. But what about along the way? If the Ruby Queen chases us, we can’t stop her, can we?”

Fa Hua said thoughtfully, “This time she appeared much slower. There must be a reason. We don’t know when she will show up again, but I’m somewhat confident I can sense her in advance. If we’re intercepted on the road, we teleport back, wait until we sense her approaching, then teleport forward again and continue toward the Ancestral Court. There should be a chance. Only when we reach the Ancestral Court of the Demon Realm can we settle down to cultivate.”

They now had a map of the Demon Domain. Undoubtedly, the Ancestral Court was very distant. Traveling across the vast land of the Demon Domain to reach it would take a long time.

There was no doubt this journey would be a great test for them. But after the battle with Hu Jiaojiao and Hu Rourou, the confidence they had almost entirely lost earlier was rekindled.

Although they could not claim they could defeat their opponents, thanks to the Peerless Pearl they were barely able to protect themselves against the Tiger Demon Princesses. A year ago, they would not even have dared to imagine contending with two Ninth-Rank Tiger Demon Clan Golden Bloodline powerhouses.

The Peerless Pearl’s greatest feature was that it gave them an extraordinary tacit understanding. This understanding also allowed their fighting styles to change in myriad ways.

Fa Hua’s plan was simple. From now on, they would run toward the Ancestral Court, leaving the teleportation coordinate here. Once they felt they were about to be caught, they would teleport back. When the Ruby Queen chased to that side, they would teleport forward to the position they had previously reached and continue on. When the enemy advanced, they retreated. When the enemy retreated, they returned and advanced again. As long as they were not instantly killed by the Ruby Queen, they would have a chance to keep moving forward. Relying on the Teleportation Ability Of The Peerless Bead, they could keep advancing. Eventually, they would reach the Ancestral Court.

“Wait a moment. Actually, I have another way.” Lan Ge’s eyes brightened as a plan formed.

Fa Hua looked at him.

Lan Ge chuckled. “We can teleport to each other. Why not separate and move forward? From Wild Monster City to here, even for the Ruby Queen it would take time. Moreover, I highly suspect she might not have provoked Great Demons in Wild Monster City. If that’s the case, our time would be even more plentiful. From now on we act separately, heading in opposite directions—look at the map.”

As he spoke, he pointed to it. From their current position, they would first go in opposite directions, then each draw an arc toward the Ancestral Court as their final destination.

Fa Hua immediately understood. “You mean we wouldn’t need to wait after teleporting back for her to come our way. Whoever encounters her teleports immediately to the other side. When she chases there, we teleport back to the first side again?”

“Exactly. This way we can keep moving forward continuously. It’ll be faster than our current method,” Lan Ge said.

Fa Hua glanced at him. “Use your brain. What about when we’re close to the Ancestral Court? We’ll both keep approaching the same point. What happens as the distance between us keeps shrinking? Think about it.”

Lan Ge was stunned for a moment. Indeed—there was only one destination. Near the end, if the two of them were too close, the space for maneuver would only shrink.

“To be safe, let’s stick to the original plan. We must be fast. The farther we get from this starting point, the safer we’ll be, because with longer teleport distances she’ll need more time to chase.” Fa Hua grabbed Lan Ge. “Go.”

As he spoke, he strode forward in the direction of the Ancestral Court.

Lan Ge waved both hands. Wind Element covered them, and their speed surged.

“Didn’t you just snap at me again?”

“What?”

“Nothing. I’m just frustrated. Why am I already a bit used to it…”

Wild Monster City.

“Boom, boom!” Hu Jiaojiao and Hu Rourou were blasted backward, their golden fur scattered, the two sisters covered in bloodstains. But the ferocity in their eyes was not diminished in the slightest.

The Tiger Demon Clan itself was a warrior people. In their hearts, the word *retreat* had never existed—even if the opponent was extremely powerful. As one of the Demon Race’s strongest eight tribes, their survival to this day rested entirely on strength.

Red light flashed. The Ruby Queen swept past, and in the next moment her two uppermost back-stingers pierced Hu Jiaojiao’s and Hu Rourou’s shoulders respectively, lifting them into midair.

“Where are those people?” the Ruby Queen asked coldly.

The intense pain—and the sensation of their Life Energy being devoured—twisted Hu Jiaojiao and Hu Rourou’s faces.

“You will die. You will definitely die! Father will not let you off. If you have the ability, then kill us! If Father had not taken the Elders out, how could you be so arrogant in my Wild Monster City?”

Yes—the Tiger Demon King was not present. In fact, if it had been otherwise, Hu Jiaojiao and Hu Rourou would not have dared to brazenly hold this so-called Matchmaking Convention.

“Whoever comes will die. I’ll give you one last chance.” As she spoke, the Ruby Queen’s brow furrowed slightly. A faint red electric light flickered in her eyes, but it only flashed briefly, as if being extinguished. What shone more strongly in her eyes, though, was intense unwillingness.

“Come on! Kill us. Father will definitely tear you apart!” Hu Jiaojiao shouted explosively, showing no sign of being subdued.

“Fine.” A fierce killing intent burst from the Ruby Queen. She lifted the two back-stingers impaling the Tiger Demon Princesses, and red light flared brilliantly, about to devour all of their Life Energy.

“Aoo!” At that moment, a low, extremely majestic roar rolled across the air.

When the roar sounded, anyone looking down from above would see the huge Wild Monster City turn a faint gold in an instant. Vaguely, a gigantic tiger head—so large it seemed to match Wild Monster City—rose from underground.

With the Ruby Queen’s cultivation, she felt her bloodline suppressed in an instant. A chill ran through her body. A heavy oppression—and an indescribable sense of danger—spread through her.

Even when she had faced the Sea Giant Emperor back then, she had not felt this.

This was clearly a crisis capable of threatening her life.
