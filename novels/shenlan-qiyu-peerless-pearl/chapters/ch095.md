# Chapter 95: Peerless Pearl’s Evolution?

When Hu Jiaojiao and Hu Rourou let out that low roar, their bodies instantly turned pure gold. A moment later, a tremendous suction came from the direction of the City Lord’s Mansion. With a flash of golden light, it tore them free from the Ruby Queen’s back-stingers and sent them flying into the depths of the City Lord’s Mansion.

The Ruby Queen’s long hair streamed behind her. With a twist, she leapt into the air, becoming an earth-shattering streak of rainbow that shot straight up. The six back-stingers behind her folded inward to guard her. Red radiance sharpened into blades and struck the golden shield that had just formed in midair.

“Puf!” She forced a gap in the shield. A bolt of red lightning split the sky, and in the next instant she Disappear Without A Trace.

The Ruby Queen had barely vanished when a streak of light appeared and a person materialized.

Yes—he was completely humanoid. At least in appearance, there was no visible difference from a Human. He stood about 1.9 meters tall, eyes like bright stars and a high, pronounced nose. He looked no more than twenty-something—handsome—and he wore a long white robe edged in silver that gave him an otherworldly air.

Cold light flickered in his eyes. The chill seemed to lower the temperature of the entire Wild Monster City.

In a flash, he became white light and entered the core of the City Lord’s Mansion.

On a huge altar more than a hundred meters across stood a lifelike golden fierce tiger statue more than thirty meters tall. Before the statue, the sisters Hu Jiaojiao and Hu Rourou lay limp on the ground, their faces pale.

“Father!”

Seeing the white-robed youth, the once-ferocious Tiger Demon Princesses cried out sadly and leapt toward him.

Their bodies were much larger than the youth’s, yet when they reached him, they both sank down and leaned against him like little birds clinging to a person. The scene was, indeed, somewhat beautiful…

The white-robed youth hugged their big heads. Cold light was grim in his eyes. “I only went out with the Elders for a few days, and someone actually dared to cause trouble in my Wild Monster City—and even injured my precious ones. Your father rushed back at once. The Elders will arrive shortly. Father will avenge you.”

Protecting one’s own is the nature of the Demon Race. They always help kin rather than uphold justice. Moreover, being humiliated by outsiders who came to bully them like this was something the Tiger Demon Clan hadn’t experienced for who knew how many years.

“Father, her armor is really pretty—take it off and give it to me,” Hu Jiaojiao said softly.

Though her voice was still muffled, the white-robed youth’s expression softened as he listened. “All right.”

“Father, I want it too!” Hu Rourou would not be outdone.

“Wait until Father brings her back. Then you may deal with her as you please.” He patted their big heads, and only then did Hu Jiaojiao and Hu Rourou rise.

The Tiger Demon King bowed to the golden fierce tiger statue. In the next moment, he became a streak of white light and flashed away.

One day later.

Fa Hua and Lan Ge sped across the wilderness. This time, they were heading for the Ancestral Court. To go as fast as possible, they avoided the main roads and, following the map, deliberately chose desolate tracks. That way they could maximize their speed and were less likely to be seen. Even so, they did not dare fly for fear of being noticed by powerful members of the Demon Race.

In a day and a night, they had already covered more than a thousand kilometers—far from the sea.

In Fa Hua’s hand, the Divine Codex had remained open to the Seventh Page the whole time, constantly watching the premonition brought by Unravelling The Truth.

As their cultivation deepened, the sensitivity of Unravelling The Truth grew ever stronger. Earlier, it had already helped them avoid disaster.

“Still not here?” Lan Ge turned and asked Fa Hua.

“You seem rather hopeful about it,” Fa Hua said.

Lan Ge laughed. “Well, actually, if you don’t consider that she wants to kill us, and if you don’t consider that she’s a big ant—after turning into human form, she’s really quite pretty. Fits my aesthetic. Don’t you think so?”

“If you want to die, don’t drag me along,” Fa Hua said indifferently.

“Just saying. Besides, it seems our prediction was correct: either she ran into trouble or her sense for us has weakened. It’s been a day and a night and she still hasn’t caught up. Looks like our chance to escape is growing. Rest a bit—we’re exhausted.”

“Mm.”

**The Peerless Come In A Pair; One Life, One Fate They Shall Share.**

White light swirled. The two, who had been moving quickly, vanished into the air simultaneously.

Only resting within the Peerless Pearl’s space is the safest. Inside the Peerless Pearl, their auras would also disappear. No pursuer could find them.

“If time allowed, I’d really like to fight that Tiger Demon Princess again. Even if we couldn’t win, we wouldn’t be beaten quickly.” Recalling that battle, Lan Ge was still somewhat excited. His coordination with Fa Hua had become ever more tacit. The two had become fully familiar with each other’s abilities and patterns. More importantly, their minds were in tune, able to predict what the other would do next.

Fa Hua said, “From what we experienced in Wild Monster City, once our strength reaches a certain level, even as Humans we’ll receive some recognition. The Ancestral Court of the Demon Realm is surely a place full of powerful ones. Once we get there, we can cultivate while looking for opportunities to challenge powerful members of the Demon and Nymphs to improve our combat experience.”

Actual combat is truly important. That fight with Hu Jiaojiao and Hu Rourou had clearly improved them. Their tacit understanding was rising too.

“Let’s cultivate,” Fa Hua said, sitting down cross-legged.

Lan Ge sat opposite him. “You’re so boring. I think you people are especially dull—only know cultivation. You Law Domain people are all like this, no fun.” Though he said this, he still raised his hands, and their four palms came together.

The instant their palms touched, everything around them changed.

Fa Hua and Lan Ge felt a momentary mental haze. To their surprise, the Peerless Pearl’s space had changed.

The Peerless Pearl’s Cultivation Space, with its time ratio of one to three compared with the outside world, had measured only about ten square meters and had been surrounded by white haze.

But now everything had changed. First, the surrounding whiteness turned pale gold. More strangely, the hazy veil became transparent, and what appeared in their view was precisely the spot where they had earlier activated the Peerless Pearl.

Everything around was very clear, allowing them to see a full 360-degree panorama. They felt as if they were suspended in midair above the place where they had first activated the Peerless Pearl.

“What’s going on?” Lan Ge asked Fa Hua in surprise.

At this moment, their four palms still touched, and their internal energies circulated on their own. They both felt something different but could not pinpoint exactly what. They only sensed that the energy flow during cultivation had become increasingly smooth.

“Could it be related to devouring the Ruby Queen’s heart?” Fa Hua said thoughtfully.

“But the change isn’t that big. Still, being able to see outside is always useful. If the Ruby Queen chases us, at least we can know the situation in advance. That’s a nice feature. But devouring a heart that could help us advance and getting such a small change? It doesn’t give anything practical—like raising both of us to Tenth-Rank in one go. Then we wouldn’t have to fear Ruby.”

“Childish. Are you expecting a free handout from the heavens?” Fa Hua scoffed.

Lan Ge’s eyes suddenly sharpened. “I don’t know whether pies fall from the sky, but a Ruby did fall from the sky.”

Fa Hua withdrew his palms and turned to look where Lan Ge was staring.

Just as Lan Ge said, a red light—like a meteor—fell from the sky, heading straight for the ground.

Relief rose in their hearts at the same time. Who would have thought the Ruby Queen would come at this moment? If she had been a step later, they might have run straight into her.

Boom—The red figure slammed into the ground with a violent roar.

Fa Hua and Lan Ge could no longer continue cultivating. They stood at once and looked toward the place where the Ruby Queen had fallen.

At that moment, they were horrified to see the sky turn completely gold—yes, as if the sun had exploded—the whole sky blazing with gold.

A Giant Golden Hand descended from the sky, pressing down.

The hand had a diameter of a kilometer, as if the sky were collapsing and the earth caving in.

The place where they had earlier entered the Cultivation Space had been a forest. Now, as the Giant Golden Hand descended, the forest crumbled into powder and scattered. The Giant Golden Hand seemed able to melt gold and iron, dissolving everything around it.

An utterly terrifying aura spread through the air. Fa Hua and Lan Ge’s eyes were full of shock. What is this?

“Ah—” a scream rang out. Beams of red radiance crisscrossed, weaving into a great net in the air that tore the Giant Golden Hand apart. The red figure shot up violently and hovered in midair—none other than the Ruby Queen.

Only, the Ruby Queen now looked somewhat battered. Two of the six back-spines behind her had been broken at some point. The Ruby Armor on her left shoulder was shattered, with cracks spreading across her chest armor and vaguely exposing patches of pale white skin.

Her face looked somewhat pallid, but her eyes were full of cold ferocity.

In the sky, the golden light receded, and a figure slowly floated forward. The white robe edged with silver and the handsome face carried a faint arrogance.

“Given that your cultivation is hard-won and you possess a Heavenly Demon Bloodline, if you are willing to be my concubine, I will spare your life. I will also overlook the offense of injuring my daughter,” the white-robed youth said calmly, his gaze revealing undisguised admiration.
