  <p>“Lucky you!” Lan Ge retorted. After he spoke, his eyes dimmed. Thinking of that blind date, he couldn&#39;t help remembering his “dead” parents, his heart aching as if pricked by needles.</p>

<p>Fa Hua realized she had touched a sore spot and raised her hand to pat his shoulder.</p>

<p>The moment their bodies touched, the Peerless Pearl linked naturally, and their breathing subtly shifted.</p>

<p>The Tiger-Demon Captain ahead immediately felt something and instinctively glanced up at them. By then Fa Hua’s hand had already fallen, and their breathing had returned to normal.</p>

<p>The inner city was enormous. After the Tiger-Demon Captain led them in and turned a corner, carriages waited there—one carriage drawn by eight Centaurs. Only the Tiger-Demon Captain boarded with them. The other Tiger-Demon soldiers ran behind the carriage, heading deeper into the inner city.</p>

<p>This was Fa Hua and Lan Ge’s first visit to the Demon Race’s core area. Along with curiosity, they also felt somewhat reassured. This was the Wild Monster City Lord’s Residence. Even if the Ruby Queen chased them now, she shouldn&#39;t pose too much of a threat. If she had the ability, then let her come! The Tiger Demon King surely wouldn&#39;t be weaker than her, right?</p>

<p>While they continued deeper toward the Lord’s Residence, events were unfolding back at the city gates.</p>

<p>Radiant Ruby Armor, six huge back-stingers, an understated aura—only an exquisitely beautiful face and figure remained. When the Ruby Queen appeared at the city gate, she immediately drew everyone’s attention. She was simply too eye-catching.</p>

<p>Her gaze remained icy, but her brows were tightly furrowed, as if pondering something.</p>

<p>“Stop!” The Elephant-Demon Captain stretched out his large nose to block the Ruby Queen&#39;s path, appraising her up and down with greedy eyes.</p>

<p>“Which clan are you from? Are you Human?” The Elephant-Demon Captain was practically salivating. If the Ruby Queen admitted to being a Human, he would attack immediately. No one would stand up for Commoners. If not for the Ruby Queen&#39;s armor being so vivid and dazzling, he probably would have acted already.</p>

<p>Several streaks of red light flashed across him. The Elephant-Demon Captain froze. In the next moment, his long nose was sliced into thin flakes that scattered through the air like falling leaves.</p>

<p>At the same time, the Ruby Queen had already appeared behind him, one hand forming a claw shape and hovering above his head.</p>

<p>The nearby Centaur soldiers were terrified and hurriedly grabbed their long spears to rush forward.</p>

<p>“Get lost!” the Ruby Queen said coldly.</p>

<p>All the surrounding Centaurs were instantly swept up and hurled into the city moat. The Elephant-Demon in front of her suffered the same fate.</p>

<p>Sunlight shone, and waves of crimson light flowed around her armor, radiant yet cold. In an instant, the greedy gazes fixed on her turned to astonishment, shock, and fear.</p>

<p>The Demon Race’s mentality was completely different from that of Humans. Seeing this scene, their first thought was *how powerful this person must be to dare act against soldiers at the city gate of Wild Monster City, one of the Tianyu Empire’s Eight Major Cities!*</p>

<p>Therefore, no one dared stop Her Majesty the Queen, and she strode into Wild Monster City.</p>

<p>In fact, the Ruby Queen had already shown mercy, which was why she did not kill those soldiers. When she had been on that small island in the Endless Blue Sea waiting for Fa Hua and Lan Ge, she had, out of anger and boredom, casually slaughtered many marine creatures and devoured their Life Energy. That drew the Sea Giant Emperor and led to a great battle.</p>

<p>Even within the Eleventh-Rank, there are strengths and weaknesses. In pure strength, the Ruby Queen, who once attempted to break through to the Twelfth-Rank, really was not below the Sea Giant Emperor. But the Endless Blue Sea was the Sea Giant Emperor&#39;s home turf. Timing, terrain, and support were not on the Ruby Queen&#39;s side, and in the end she was driven away.</p>

<p>Having chased them all the way to the Demon Domain, she had learned her lesson and no longer killed lightly, holding back. Otherwise, given her iron-fisted methods in the Swallowing Ant Race, none of the surrounding Demon Race who had looked at her with greedy eyes would have survived, let alone these guards.</p>

<p>The Swallowing Ant Race has existed since the Ice Age. They have always lived in a symbiotic but adversarial relationship with the Sea Tree Tribe on the surface, effectively two sides of the Green Sea of Life, and long survived under the Sea Tree Tribe&#39;s suppression. So they rarely come to the surface world. The Ruby Queen endured for a thousand years for the sake of one day breaking through to the Twelfth-Rank, becoming a Great Heavenly God and crushing the Sea Tree Tribe, thereby monopolizing the entire Green Sea of Life. Unexpectedly, by chance, Fa Hua and Lan Ge ruined that plan and caused her to fail at the last moment. In her heart there was now only one persistent thought: to take back her heart and carve those two Humans to pieces.</p>

<p>But when she came near the Demon Domain and sensed this vast, nearly boundless continent, she truly trembled inwardly. At her level of cultivation, her premonition ability was extremely strong. She could clearly sense that in this vast world there existed beings capable of truly killing her.</p>

<p>The Ruby Queen was by no means low in intelligence like ordinary Swallowing Ants. On the contrary, her intelligence was no less than ordinary Humans’. After feeling fear, her actions naturally stopped being wanton.</p>

<p>Wild Monster City, City Lord&#39;s Mansion.</p>

<p>The City Lord’s Mansion was indeed enormous. Even riding in a Centaur-drawn carriage, it took a full half hour to reach their destination.</p>

<p>This was an open square—yes, a square. An expanse no smaller than the Thunder City Royal Palace Square. Before entering this area, Fa Hua and Lan Ge had vaguely heard Tiger-Demons mention the Martial Arena.</p>

<p>In the center of the Martial Arena, a high platform had been built. It looked a bit crude, just assembled from stones and wooden blocks. Two figures stood on the platform.</p>

<p>Looking closely, the two figures were large-boned and broad-shouldered, with straight noses and square mouths, tiger eyes and lion noses. Their powerful auras carried a certain peerless intimidation.</p>

<p>The only somewhat incongruous thing was that each of the two wore a large flower by their ear—one apricot-yellow, one pink—which was somewhat out of keeping with their imposing physiques.</p>

<p>Because of the distance, they couldn’t make out the faces, but given that this was a Martial Matchmaking and considering the two on the platform, Lan Ge’s heart twitched, and he couldn’t help asking, “Brother Tiger General, are those two on the high platform the Princesses for the Martial Matchmaking?”</p>

<p>The Tiger-Demon Captain looked back at them and, with a righteous and solemn air, said, “Exactly!”</p>

<p>Lan Ge swallowed hard. “Are you sure you didn&#39;t misspeak—those are the Princesses? Not the Princes?”</p>

<p>The Tiger-Demon Captain&#39;s eyes flashed. “What do you mean?” His fierce look seemed to ask, *Do you want to die?*</p>

<p>Fa Hua pulled Lan Ge and transmitted in her mind, “Since we&#39;re here, make the best of it.”</p>

<p>They had been through a lot. They had even managed to escape from the Ruby Queen. Besides, they had already prepared a teleport point. If something went wrong, they could just run.</p>

<p>“It&#39;s nothing. I just think the two Princesses are exceptionally gifted, with peerless looks—both have the bearing to inherit the Demon King&#39;s dominion!” Lan Ge immediately put on a smile and said admiringly.</p>

<p>Only then did the Tiger-Demon Captain turn his anger into joy and laugh heartily. “Brother, you&#39;re right! Our Demon King only has these two Princesses. Naturally, in the future they will inherit the throne. So if you two can really be favored by the Princesses, it&#39;s like ascending in one step and saving decades of effort!”</p>

<p>Lan Ge wailed inwardly and said to Fa Hua, “Let&#39;s strive—really strive. I suddenly feel cultivation isn&#39;t tedious at all.”</p>

<p>Fa Hua said calmly, “Marrying a Demon King&#39;s daughter and becoming a high-ranking Demon—that&#39;s pretty good. Or you could just stay.”</p>

<p>Lan Ge snarled, “Cut that out. Don&#39;t forget, given our current relationship, if I really marry that burly Tiger-Demon and she does anything to me, I&#39;ll make sure to share the experience with you in my heart. Let you know what empathy feels like.”</p>

<p>“Forget I said that.”</p>

<p>While they were talking, they had already reached the center of the Martial Arena. By then, some young people of various races had gathered around, but the number was not large. Not exactly deserted, but in total fewer than twenty. This was indeed somewhat inconsistent with a Demon King&#39;s daughter&#39;s Martial Matchmaking.</p>

<p>The crowd was naturally mostly Demon Race. As soon as Fa Hua and Lan Ge joined this group, they found that everyone waiting here wore worried expressions. None of them looked like they had come for Martial Matchmaking.</p>

<p>The Tiger-Demon Captain said to Fa Hua and Lan Ge, “You two wait here. It will start soon.” After saying this, he had the two disembark from the carriage and hurried away.</p>

<p>Fa Hua and Lan Ge deliberately moved a few steps to the edge to make themselves less conspicuous. In fact, there were many Demon Race here. Although many had humanoid appearances, they were somewhat different from Humans, and many were large-bodied, so the two did not stand out.</p>

<p>“You two were also grabbed to be matched?” came a lowered voice.</p>

<p>Fa Hua and Lan Ge turned to look. The speaker was a young man whose build looked about the same as theirs, but his face was an ashen-blue. This was not because he was ill; his skin actually looked like that. Otherwise, he was no different from Humans.</p>

<p>Lan Ge said, “Brother, please. Your use of the word ‘also’ seems to imply something!”</p>

<p>The ashen-blue-faced youth smiled bitterly. “Of course. If we weren&#39;t grabbed by them, who would voluntarily come to participate in the Princesses’ Martial Matchmaking?”</p>

<p>“Oh? What&#39;s wrong with the Princesses being large and dignified in figure and majestic in appearance?” Lan Ge asked, feigning surprise.</p>
