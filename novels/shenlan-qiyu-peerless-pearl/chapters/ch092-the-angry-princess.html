        <h1>Chapter 92: The Angry Princess</h1>
      </header>

      <main>
        <p>A flash of light, and Fa Hua split into two, as if Hu Jiaojiao had cleaved him. The two figures’ Wisdom Swords slashed simultaneously—not at Hu Jiaojiao, but at the air beside her.</p>
<p>Hu Jiaojiao’s mind went blank, as if she had lost something vital in an instant. Instinctively, she turned to look at Hu Rourou behind her. In that moment, she felt her sister had suffered some terrible attack.</p>
<p>Slashing Emotions of the Wisdom Sword struck most directly at the emotions.</p>
<p>At that moment, Lan Ge—who had been behind Fa Hua—suddenly blurred. His blue-purple figure transformed into a Lightning Flash and appeared in front of Hu Jiaojiao.</p>
<p>A palm struck Hu Jiaojiao’s chest, blue-purple flames bursting forth. “Boom—” Hu Jiaojiao’s burly body was blasted backward, her entire form wreathed in blue-purple flames as she crashed toward Hu Rourou behind her.</p>
<p>Lightning Flash connected with Thunder–Fire Explosion!</p>
<p>This time, Lan Ge had charged his power. His Combination Spells unleashed the full explosive force of thunder and fire. Although Hu Jiaojiao’s defense was astonishing, she was caught off guard and blasted tens of meters away.</p>
<p>What shocked Fa Hua and Lan Ge was that although Lan Ge’s palm had blasted Hu Jiaojiao back, at the moment of impact he felt a terrifying aura on her suddenly swell outward. It dissolved most of the explosion’s force and even knocked Lan Ge back three or four steps. Her body’s toughness was evident.</p>
<p>All of this happened extremely fast. From the Wind Blades erupting to Hu Jiaojiao being blasted away, only a few seconds had passed.</p>
<p>Many young powerhouses watching from afar couldn’t help staring in astonishment.</p>
<p>What’s going on? The Grand Princess was blasted away?</p>
<p>But the fight clearly wasn’t over. The instant Hu Jiaojiao was blasted away, Hu Rourou had already arrived.</p>
<p>Seeing her sister blasted back, Hu Rourou grew anxious and let out a tiger roar. A faint golden light-shadow of a giant tiger appeared behind her. Hu Rourou cried out in anger as her tiger claws swelled and thrust forward!</p>
<p>In that instant, all Fa Hua and Lan Ge could see was gold. Those tiger claws became dozens of meters long in the blink of an eye, covering every space they could use to dodge.</p>
<p>Whether Fa Hua quickly raised his Wisdom Shield or Lan Ge released layer upon layer of Elemental Defense, those defenses were torn apart by the tiger claws.</p>
<p>It was an utterly unstoppable, terrifying attack!</p>
<p>These two Humans are finished!</p>
<p>Almost all of the Demon Race present had the same thought.</p>
<p>At the Martial Matchmaking, the tiger Demon Princesses normally showed restraint. At most they would severely injure opponents, but they wouldn’t actually kill them. Otherwise, the Martial Matchmaking would be unjustifiable.</p>
<p>But in the heat of the moment, Hu Rourou had obviously not considered that. With that claw strike, she had already used her Bloodline Demon God Technique!</p>
<p>Just as Hu Rourou felt she had struck a bit too hard—and wondered how she would handle the two Humans’ deaths afterward—a strange scene occurred.</p>
<p>Fa Hua suddenly caught up to Lan Ge from behind. At the moment the earth-shattering tiger claw descended, a flash of white light—and the two simultaneously Disappear Without A Trace, vanishing into the air.</p>
<p>“Boom—”</p>
<p>The fierce tiger strike hit the ground, leaving five deep claw marks thirty meters long. The entire Martial Arena—even the whole City Lord’s Mansion area—trembled violently, like an earthquake.</p>
<p>But that claw had not struck anyone.</p>
<p>Hu Rourou was stunned. What was happening?</p>
<p>With another flash of white light, Fa Hua and Lan Ge had already reappeared where they had been before. But when they saw the huge trench beneath them, they couldn’t help but feel a chill of fear.</p>
<p>This Princess really is too fierce!</p>
<p>“You dared touch my chest!” At that moment, an indescribably terrifying, murderous aura exploded abruptly!</p>
<p>Hu Jiaojiao stood about a dozen meters behind Hu Rourou, arms hanging naturally at her sides. Her eyes had turned a deep, dark gold. Within a fifty-meter radius, the air grew heavy and dim beneath her aura.</p>
<p>That terrifying aura made everyone present—except for Fa Hua, Lan Ge, and Hu Rourou—hastily retreat to the edge of the Martial Arena.</p>
<p>Lan Ge shivered. Without a doubt, Hu Jiaojiao was talking reminded him of him.</p>
<p>But that chest as hard as steel—did he really touch it? He had clearly been blasted away by it.</p>
<p>In that instant, he suddenly understood something. No matter what kind of woman—even if she is as hard as steel and as majestic as a mountain—she still cares about some things…</p>
<p>“Ahem, ahem! Your Highness the Princess, I really didn’t do it on purpose!”</p>
<p>Hu Jiaojiao walked toward them slowly, step by step, her face so sullen it seemed to drip water.</p>
<p>“Today, if I can’t kill you, I’ll really marry you!”</p>
<p>Lan Ge’s pupils instantly contracted. Instinctively, he thought, <em>Then I’d rather die.</em></p>
<p>Fa Hua bumped him with his shoulder. “Be careful! Don’t die. If you die, I’ll die too.”</p>
<p>Although Lan Ge thought that inwardly, his hands were not idle. One Wind Blade after another—and Fireballs—shot out, filling all the space in front of him and Fa Hua.</p>
<p>“Roar!” Hu Rourou let out a fierce roar. A burst of golden light expanded, faintly forming a tiger-head shape, blocking in front of her and Hu Jiaojiao and stopping those elemental attacks.</p>
<p>Hu Jiaojiao was already in a pounce, rushing straight at Lan Ge.</p>
<p>A flash of white light, and Holy Aura burst forth as Fa Hua’s body suddenly swelled. Condensed Holy Magic gushed out, and the Wisdom Shield in his hand took on a heavier radiance.</p>
<p>Pushing off with his feet, he charged.</p>
<p>Having activated Holy Spiritual Body, his figure became even larger than Hu Jiaojiao’s, and the Wisdom Shield was greatly amplified. But in Hu Jiaojiao’s eyes, there was only disdain. With only a tilt of her head, she charged. She had absolute confidence in her strength. Even among the many rulers with Golden Bloodline, few at the same level could match her.</p>
<p>Could Fa Hua hold back this Ninth-Rank tigress in a frontal strength collision? The answer was obviously no.</p>
<p>But he used a Wisdom Shield, not a Savage Shield.</p>
<p>At the moment the two were about to collide, Fa Hua subtly shifted his stance. Instead of charging head-on, his body tilted to the side, turning into a right-shoulder-forward thrust, and the Wisdom Shield naturally canted at an angle.</p>
<p>Bang! They collided!</p>
<p>Fa Hua’s body spun from the impact, using the Wisdom Shield’s leverage to dissipate most of the force. Hu Jiaojiao’s momentum was redirected, her feet stumbling as she charged off to the side.</p>
<p>A sinister pillar of water appeared just as her foot faltered. The water pillar couldn’t harm Hu Jiaojiao, of course—but if it nudged her supporting foot while she was slightly out of control, it would be enough.</p>
<p>Hu Jiaojiao’s body tilted, and she fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Fa Hua’s rotating body did not pause in the slightest. Using that rotational momentum, he propelled himself toward Hu Rourou. The Divine Codex flipped to Page Seven. Fa Hua lightly flicked a finger, and a golden thread snapped.</p>
<p>On the other side, Hu Jiaojiao’s loss of control filled her with anger and shock. She slapped her right hand to the ground to rebound—but that handstrike was inexplicably half a beat slow. It landed only as her face struck the ground, sending her sprawling and covered in dust.</p>
<p>A purple light—late to depart but early to arrive—reached Fa Hua as he appeared before Hu Rourou. Their shoulders collided, and the Peerless Pearl connected.</p>
<p>A flash of light appeared in Fa Hua’s right hand, and the Wisdom Sword thrust forward!</p>
<p>At the instant the sword thrust, Hu Rourou felt as if the Human before her had vanished. The sword beam was like a world-shocking rainbow descending from the sky, flashing in an instant.</p>
<p>The inescapable feeling startled her. She raised her tiger claws to block the beam.</p>
<p>But for some reason, Fa Hua’s eyes flashed through her mind—a clarity that seemed to swallow even her soul. Her movements immediately slowed.</p>
<p>“Ding!” Fa Hua’s Wisdom Sword landed on Hu Rourou’s shoulder. Hu Rourou’s whole body trembled. The Wisdom Sword had not pierced her, yet she felt as if something had been driven through her. There was no pain—only the sense that she had lost something. Her tiger eyes immediately filled with bewilderment.</p>
<p>The instant Lan Ge’s shoulder struck Fa Hua, his right hand slapped forward. Three flashes of light from his palm struck Hu Rourou’s other shoulder. Purple light detonated first, thunder overlaying it, then an exploding Fireball, and finally a piercing Wind Cone—three attributes in succession, completed in an instant. Hu Rourou’s body spun and was blasted away.</p>
<p>On the other side, Hu Jiaojiao—just getting up, covered in dust—saw her sister knocked flying. Fury surged through her, but there was also a glint of sternness.</p>
<p>If the first time she was blasted away was because of carelessness, what about the second time? The opponent could nullify her attack first and then still repel Hu Rourou—was that just luck?</p>
<p>When she had just tumbled, there had been a hard-to-describe sensation, as though her strength could not be exerted—as if she were sinking into a quagmire.</p>
<p>Actually, it wasn’t only Hu Jiaojiao and Hu Rourou who were surprised. Even the two instigators, Fa Hua and Lan Ge, were astonished.</p>
<p>All their tacit understanding seemed to have formed naturally. Their minds were in tune. They knew exactly what the other would do next and cooperated instinctively, making their attacks almost seamless. When their bodies touched, they could briefly approach Ninth-Rank cultivation—yet their opponents were two Golden Bloodline Ninth-Rank Experts!</p>
<p>But after two successive clashes, they were surprised to find that their opponents were not quite as terrifying as they had imagined.</p>
<p>In fact, having cultivated with the Peerless Pearl for so long, their tacit understanding had long since formed. When facing the Ruby Queen, it was simply that the Ruby Queen herself was too powerful, so they never had the chance to display it.</p>
<p>Facing this pair of tiger Demon Princesses now, however, they finally unleashed the full accumulation of the past year and more.</p>
