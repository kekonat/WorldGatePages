# Chapter 93: Golden Claw Prison

“Boom—” Hu Jiaojiao stomped her right foot. The ground cracked open, and a shockwave barreled straight toward Fa Hua and Lan Ge.

On the other side, Hu Rourou slammed to the ground. She tried to get up, but her mind went blank and she briefly lost consciousness. Being struck by the Wisdom Sword was not so simple. Although her cultivation exceeded Fa Hua and Lan Ge’s, when Fa Hua had just thrust that sword he was near Ninth-Rank, and Slashing Emotions had sealed her emotions.

Fa Hua’s body turned cyan in an instant. The Wisdom Shield retracted, and he gripped the Wisdom Sword with both hands. He pointed it to the sky, drew it to the earth, and slashed.

A cyan sword radiance shot out three feet—condensed, unscattered. Amid the piercing sound of tearing fabric, his single sword actually split the shockwave open.

Fa Hua’s body shifted to blue-purple, and with a crack he was already in front of Hu Jiaojiao. His sword thrust split into four beams, stabbing toward her shoulders and both hips.

The young Demon Race elites watching were a little dumbfounded. What was going on? Those two Humans were clearly only Ninth-Rank. How could they put the two Princesses to such shame?

At least on the surface, Fa Hua and Lan Ge had always held the upper hand. Hu Jiaojiao and Hu Rourou had even suffered losses at their hands.

Fa Hua’s thrust came extremely fast, the sword light inhaling and exhaling. Augmented by the Lightning Element, this sword was as fast as lightning.

If it were only the explosive augmentation of the Lightning Element, it would normally interfere with his sword intent. But he and Lan Ge were of one mind. When Lan Ge’s Lightning Element energy transmitted over, Fa Hua naturally gained understanding and insight into the Lightning Element. When he thrust the sword, there was an immediate sense that the world belonged to him.

Lan Ge stood right behind him, hands pressed to his back. The two were as if connected.

Hu Jiaojiao was also startled. But just as she inwardly grew stern, this normally furious Tiger Demon Clan Princess calmed down.

She was a born warrior of the Golden Lineage, her innate combat power extremely strong. She stepped her left foot sideways, planting her legs wide for balance, and her tiger claws sliced out.

“Clang, clang, clang, clang!” Four crisp sounds rang out as the four sword beams were completely blocked by her.

It must be known that Fa Hua’s Light-Splitting Sword Technique had already reached Unity Of Heaven And Man. Yet at this moment, what he felt from Hu Jiaojiao was a powerful will—an overbearing aura that dominated the world—an invincible force. Her tiger claws carried savagery and domineering intensity, delivering an overwhelming, crushing impact.

This was the true strength of this Princess!

Golden halos flicked off her tiger claws, precisely dissolving the electric radiance conducted into her body during the collisions. A thick golden Bloodline Aura surged forth in a ranged impact.

Fa Hua bore the brunt first. The Holy Magic light granted by the Divine Statue flared, making him as steady as a mountain. Even with Lan Ge’s augmentation, he still retreated half a step.

Hu Jiaojiao stepped in and charged with her shoulders down!

The Wisdom Shield released to block. At the same time, driven by the Wind Element, Fa Hua sidestepped instantly. A blue vortex appeared beneath Hu Jiaojiao’s feet without warning, making her previously steady body sway.

Fa Hua’s Wisdom Shield struck horizontally and collided with Hu Jiaojiao’s swinging tiger claw. The Wisdom Shield shattered with a crack, and the tiger claw was swept aside. The shattered shield broke into countless small shields, striking at the important joints of Hu Jiaojiao’s body.

A pillar of fire spurted from the ground beside Hu Jiaojiao and rushed straight for her waist.

All these changes happened too fast. Hu Jiaojiao clearly felt that the two’s combined energy was inferior to her own, yet their many strange attacks coordinated so tacitly that she still felt flustered. As before, she could not release her full strength. The opponents simply did not give her the chance to charge up for a full-collision blow.

She could only defend hastily and shouted, “Second sister!”

Hu Jiaojiao’s shout truly shocked everyone present. This call almost meant that by her own strength she could not defeat Fa Hua and Lan Ge, which was undoubtedly recognition of the two’s strength!

When Fa Hua and Lan Ge said they were Humans, including Tie Yiran, almost everyone subconsciously regarded them as inferior. In the eyes of these powerful members of the Demon Race, what are Humans? Slaves. Even those Humans who have freedom in the Law Domain, Blue Domain, or Saint Domain are nothing more than vassals of the Demon Domain, and can be annexed whenever the Demon Domain wishes. The fundamental reason is that Humans are weak!

Who would have thought that Hu Jiaojiao—undefeated among the younger generation—would call for aid when facing two cooperating Humans. How incredible was that? Were these two really Humans?

At this moment, Hu Rourou finally recovered from the Wisdom Sword’s strike. “Roar, roar, roar!” Three tiger roars rang out as she pounced forward, cold ruthlessness shining in her tiger eyes. As she leapt, the golden glow on her body began to change. The original golden halo fully integrated with her body; a layer of long fur sprouted, revealing variegated tiger-skin patterns. Her body swelled, each hair streaming with golden light. In a nearly three-meter stalwart form—still humanoid—she became a Golden Tiger.

This Second Princess was truly enraged, especially after being struck by the Wisdom Sword earlier and briefly blanking. Her sealed emotions had dredged up many unpleasant memories—such as discovering when she was young that their father had secret liaisons with other female tigers behind their mother’s back.

Having previously held back, she now finally displayed her full power!

She lunged forward, her figure like lightning, every hair on her body bursting with golden light. Lan Ge’s successive Elemental attacks blanketed the area, but before they could reach her they were melted by the Bloodline Aura she emitted.

Hu Jiaojiao retreated—her first active retreat—and golden light erupted from her body. Like Hu Rourou, she released her Golden Tiger form, nullifying the attacks Fa Hua and Lan Ge chased after.

Feeling the soaring auras of these two Princesses, Fa Hua and Lan Ge both felt a chill in their hearts. This was no longer Ninth-Rank, but Ninth-Rank Peak!

After transforming into Golden Tigers, the cultivation of these two Princesses seemed only one step away from God Level.

Hu Jiaojiao and Hu Rourou stood shoulder to shoulder. In the next moment, they leapt together again. Golden light filled the sky and the ground. The entire Martial Arena was instantly bathed in gold.

The talented young Demon Race elites almost without hesitation turned and fled—at full speed.

In the next instant, tiger roars and claw shadows filled every corner of the Martial Arena.

The raised platform was instantly torn to pieces, as if completely disintegrated. In that terrifying golden energy, it turned to dust.

Every corner of the Martial Arena was flooded with that golden radiance. It seemed composed of countless fine golden tiger claws.

From a distance, one could see that within the Martial Arena a huge golden sphere of light had formed, and everything was swallowed by it in an instant.

It would not only be Fa Hua and Lan Ge who were attacked. As twin sisters with a bloodline connection, Hu Jiaojiao and Hu Rourou’s combined strike was already enough to rival a Tenth-Rank Demon God-level powerhouse.

“Hoo hoo, hoo hoo!”

For a full five seconds, the golden light gradually retracted in a haze. The entire Martial Arena—even the ground—was crisscrossed with claw shadows. Many areas of the ground had collapsed as well.

Hu Jiaojiao and Hu Rourou’s breathing was noticeably rapid. Unleashing that strike had been a heavy burden for them.

“Those two guys? Have they already been torn to pieces?” Hu Rourou said angrily.

Hu Jiaojiao snorted coldly. “They’re too sly! Only by using this method can we leave them nowhere to hide. Even space-type abilities cannot resist our Golden Claw Prison.”

The ferocity in Hu Rourou’s eyes gradually eased. “Sister, don’t you think we were too brutal? After today, people might not want to come anymore.”

Hu Jiaojiao curled her lip in disdain. “Those trash—whether they come or not makes no difference. That said, those two Humans were somewhat interesting. Although I hate their clingy, messy fighting style, I must admit they’re stronger than that trash. Only Ninth-Rank, yet they could make us use our full strength.”

Hu Rourou snorted. “But their fighting style is too annoying. It wasn’t satisfying. Kill them if you want. Sister, you’re not actually thinking of marrying a Human, are you?”

Hu Jiaojiao puffed out her chest. “I don’t care what race. Only an overwhelmingly strong, peerless hero has the qualification to be my husband!”

Hu Rourou glared and shouted, “Well said! I’m the same.”

At that moment, with a flash of white light, two figures reappeared in front of them.

“You haven’t won yet,” Fa Hua said calmly.

Hu Jiaojiao and Hu Rourou were both stunned. Standing before them were none other than Fa Hua and Lan Ge. Not dead? These two actually weren’t dead? Even the Golden Claw Prison hadn’t been able to kill them?

Lan Ge chuckled lightly. “Two Princesses, would you care to come again?”

Of course they weren’t dead. The moment they sensed something amiss, they instantly teleported to the Peerless Pearl’s cultivation space, and deliberately waited a while before teleporting back out.

“Roar—” both Princesses roared in rage and lunged together!

Just as they pounced, Fa Hua and Lan Ge’s expressions both changed drastically. A light flashed on Fa Hua and he vanished first. Immediately after, Lan Ge vanished as well, slipping away before they could reach them and disappearing without a trace.

Hu Jiaojiao and Hu Rourou pounced on empty air, instantly furious beyond control.

“Bastards! Those two are too sly—they ran again.”

“Boom—” the main gate of the Martial Arena shattered, and seven or eight figures were flung in. They were all Tiger Demon Clan warriors. A blood-red figure strode in step by step.
